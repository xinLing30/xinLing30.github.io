Orange is the edible fruit of various citrus trees. It belongs to the Rutaceae family and is one of the most popular fruits around the world.

The common orange is spherical to slightly oblate in shape, usually measuring around 6–9 cm (2.4–3.5 in) in diameter. It features a bright, vibrant, textured peel that ranges from orange - yellow to deep orange in color. This peel is both fragrant and slightly bumpy, protecting the juicy segments inside. The flesh of an orange is divided into numerous wedges filled with succulent, juicy, and pulp - filled vesicles. These vesicles are filled with a sweet - tart liquid, giving the fruit its characteristic refreshing taste. The flesh is typically a rich, bright orange color, and it may contain small, edible seeds in some varieties. Oranges are known for their high vitamin C content and have a lively, zesty flavor that can be both sweet and tangy, making them a delicious and healthy snack.
